Readme:

To run the program, just run the included Makefile (command: make) with the command make. Then make sure you run the server first with ./server (PORTNUMBER) (ARRAY_SIZE) where PORTNUMBER (without brackets) is a argument of the port in which the server will bind to. The ARRAY_SIZE is the next argument which will specify how large of an array will be created and maintained by the server. Example: ./server 3000 100 - to create a server with port 3000 and an array of size 100. After running the server first, you can run the client in a similar fashion. ./client (PORTNUMBER) (ARRAY_SIZE) where PORTNUMBER and ARRAY_SIZE are the same for the corresponding server you want to connect to. If you differ in PORTNUMBER you won't connect with that server, and if you differ in ARRAY_SIZE you will run into memory errors with the server only if your ARRAY_SIZE is larger due to out-of-bounds index. However if you put a lower number you will only be limited within that range for the server. Example (To run it): ./client 3000 100 - to create a client that creates threads to connect with port 3000 and request read/writes of a range up to 100.
